### Haskell compiler
Download a Haskell compiler - https://www.haskell.org/platform/

### Compiling scripts
In the terminal/console navigate to the directory in which the script is saved, then run "ghci"
Once in ghc's interactive mode, type the name of the scipt (without the extension):
'''
:l scriptName
'''
Once the compilation is done, you can use the functions within the ghci.
